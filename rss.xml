&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;포털에서 제공해주는 블로그&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Express 같은 CMS 이용&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;정적 웹사이트 생성기&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;나는 요새 대세라고 불리는 정적 사이트 생성기를 이용하여 블로그를 개설하기로 하였다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;사실 제일 유명한 생성기는 jekyll이다. 왜냐하면 Github Page에서 jekyll을 제공해주고 있기 때문이다. 그래서 많은 개발자들이 jekyll을 사용하고 있지만, jekyll은 Ruby 언어로 작성이 되어있다. 나는 따로 Ruby를 배우지 않았고, 요즘 react를 공부하고 있기 때문에 gatsby를 이용하기로 한다. github이 페이지를 배포함에 있어서 익숙하지만 나는 netlify를 이용하여 배포를 해볼 생각이다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;정리 1. 자바스크립트, reactr 기반의 정적사이트 생성기를 이용하여 블로그 개설&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;정리 2. netlify를 이용하여 블로그 배포&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;정리 3. &lt;a href=&quot;https://nodejs.org/ko/&quot;&gt;Node&lt;/a&gt;가 설치되어 있어야함. 설치확인은 터미널에서 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ node -v&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npm -v&lt;/code&gt; 으로 확인!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/quick-start&quot;&gt;Gatsby 공식문서 - quick start&lt;/a&gt; 를 이용하면 빠르게 설치할 수 있다. 간단하게 페이지 생성을 어떻게 하는지 맛만 보고, 바로 테마를 적용해보는 것을 추천한다. 이번 포스틍에서는 간단하게 quick start를 이용하여 빠르게 페이지 생성에 대해 알아본다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gatsby CLI 설치&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npm install -g gatsby-cli&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;새 사이트 생성&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npx gatsby new gatsby-site&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; 를 사용하면 최신 gatsby로 유지하여 사용할 수 있다. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;npx&lt;/code&gt; 붙이지 않아도 무관.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;폴더로 진입하여 개발모드로 시작&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ cd gatsby-site&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npm run develop&lt;/code&gt; 혹은 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ gatsby develop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:8000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/a&gt; 에서 페이지 만든 것을 확인 할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;배포모드로 시작&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ npm run build&lt;/code&gt; 혹은 &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;$ gatsby build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:9000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:9000&lt;/a&gt; 에서 페이지 만든 것을 확인 할 수 있다.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named
Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;On deer horse aboard tritely yikes and much&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad
Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text
didn’t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and
made herself on the way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This however showed weasel&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well uncritical so misled&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;this is very interesting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Goodness much until that fluid owl&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When she reached the first hills of the &lt;strong&gt;Italic Mountains&lt;/strong&gt;, she had a last
view back on the skyline of her hometown &lt;em&gt;Bookmarksgrove&lt;/em&gt;, the headline of
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Alphabet Village&lt;/a&gt; and the subline of her own road, the Line
Lane. Pityful a rhetoric question ran over her cheek, then she continued her
way. On her way she met a copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Overlaid the jeepers uselessly much excluding&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a
few insidious Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with
&lt;a href=&quot;http://google.com&quot;&gt;Longe and Parole&lt;/a&gt; and dragged her into their agency, where
they abused her for their projects again and again. And if she hasn’t been
rewritten, then they are still using her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and
Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove
right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your
mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is
an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the
name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;According a funnily until pre-set or arrogant well cheerful&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad

Village and the subline of her own road, the Line Lane. Pityful a rhetoric
question ran over her cheek, then she continued her way. On her way she met a
copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The copy warned the Little Blind Text, that where it came from it would have
been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its origin
would be the word “and” and the Little Blind Text should turn around and
return to its own, safe country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But nothing the copy said could convince her and so it didn’t take long until a

egg yolk will be less rich.”?
